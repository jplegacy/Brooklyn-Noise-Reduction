            <p>According to the statistics from 59Boards.nyc the brooklyn 304 district area is vastly effected by noise such as the police being forced to respond to a loud music complaint on the streets/sidewalk in the 371 Menahan St area on Sept 2nd, 2017 and took as long as a whole hour and 22 minutes to resolve! Another incident in which a residents was producing loud and unwanted music and the police took and hour and 26 minutes to reslove this issue on July 16th, 2017 was in the same area. With over 669 noise complaints from 2013-2018 in the 371 menahan area and over 31k in the entire Brooklyn 304 district from 2013-2018 which vastly outscales all other complains, for an example the 2nd mostly repoted issue in the Brooklyn 304 district is Heat/Hot water that only has half the complains with 15k from 2013-2018. Knowing this its very clear noise is a very hot issue in the Brooklyn 304 district, but wht is the root of this problem and how do we solve it? </p>

            <p>So firstly, why is this issue so relavent? That can be chalked up to many things like rude neighbors, loud cars, close parties, etc... But the biggest reason we are gonna touch on is thin walls with little to no soundproofing. This issue is prevelant in almost all NYC apartment coplexes and with New Yorks reputuation for being a busy and noisey city with all the cars and people doing as they please all over its clear why noise complains are such a big issue in places like Brooklyn district 304. </p>
            <p>Now that we know the big issue with the Brooklyn 304 district and noise complains, how are we gonna solve the issue in a reasonable and benficial way. The first thing that comes to mind would be community funding for soundproofing neighborhoods. On average soundproofing costs anywhere between $1,030 to $2,500 to soundproof a 1,500</p>
